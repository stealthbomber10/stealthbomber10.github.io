My internship this summer has been pretty nice (thanks Amazon), so I thought I'd write the post that I wish had been out there for me to read when I was trying to get a job in the tech industry. There's a lot I learned in the past year or so, #1 being that **this stuff is not intuitive at all**. If the statement "internship requires past internship experience" is as much of a surprise to you as it was to me, then, boy, do you have a lot to learn.

Receiving an offer essentially boils down to three major things:
    1. Developing a Resume
    2. Finding an "in"
    3. Acing your interview

Some of this is what I've learned from reading other similar posts about internship help. I'll be taking what I actually found useful from those sources and aggregating them here, plus compounding it with what I saw firsthand. Essentially, this is an info dump of anything I think is useful to know.

Gettig an offer is all about finding opportunities and taking advantage of them. Like anything else, it's a skill that needs to be learned.

This advice is aimed at US undergrads in their sophomore or junior year of university who don't go to a target engineering school, or even one that's well-ranked.  Sorry internationals, I don't share your struggles so I can't really provide any help. You could always just to go to Hong Kong like I did last summer (highly recommend). I'm also providing advice for those of us who don't go a target engineering school or even one that's decently ranked (like mine). If you go to MIT or Stanford, you're honestly pretty much set.

I took some inspiration from [this genius](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-doing-something-i-love-landed-me-a-top-tier-tech-internship-fe78d8b74e48) and hit up nearly every recruiter I had contacted earlier and even some new ones.

You can bet I felt like a big baller when I told them to piss off and smashed that delete button.

There are really two big parts to the process:
1. Getting an Interview
2. Killing the Interview

Contrary to popular belief, these do not relate to each other. What gets you the interview does not get you the job. Once you have the interview, it's about your performance *in* that interview and nothing else.

## Hacking your Resume

You don't want a crappy resume to be the reason you're not getting interviews. This is the only thing recruiters are looking at to choose who to interview, so you need to make it as dynamite as you can. Mine from freshman year absolutely sucked, so I scrapped it a year later and made a completely new document.

Luckily, there are templates that other people have made for you. In my opinion, just go with the [Deedy Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). It's clean, it'll show you're in with the HN-hipster CS crowd, and it might even be your first introduction to LaTeX. I guarantee that it's better than anything you'll end up making from scratch. You can thank me later.

[These](https://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/) 
are nice if you want something more bare-bones, and [this template](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv) is also pretty good. Still can't go wrong with Deedy though.

Put down *as much* technical experience as you can. My recruiters and interviewers never asked or cared about anything non-technical on my resume. Only put down that stuff if you really have nothing else to write (like I did), and even then just try to think of something.

Make a GitHub and a personal website (see my post [here](https://trentandraka.me/guide/2017/09/09/personal-site-guide.html), though some of it is out-of-date), and put both down on your resume. The big companies will never look at either when you're applying, but they look good to have on there. Upload anything technical you've worked on to GitHub and put links to the repos on your resume. A link to a live demo in particular is money.

Include the higher of your cumulative and major GPA. Leave it off completely if they're both less than 3.0.

## Copping the Interview

## Killing the Interview

Once you've secured the interview, your performance as judged by the interviewer is the only thing that determines whether you get the job. Your resume, grades, and projects do not matter at that poin at all at that point.

Dropbox sent me a HackerRank challenge only because I doxxed a recruiter and told her I had another offer on the table. I didn't advance past the challenge, but at that point is was all about my ability to advance. That's all about you can really ask for with this stuff.

## Appendix: freshman edition

You'll notice that I didn't mention freshmen at all. Truth is, it's difficult for most freshman to get an internship at these big tech companies unless you're at a top school or are a rockstar programmer (in which case I don't know why you kept reading after the last fourth or fifth paragraph). Your best bet is to apply to a ~~leftist diversity program~~ specialized freshman engineering internship, e.g. something like the [Microsoft Explore Program](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/explore) or [Facebook's Engineering University](https://www.facebook.com/careers/university/fbueng) thing. Either that, or try to leverage any sort of connections you might have, whether it be from school, friends, family, or something else.

Your highest chance of success, however, will most likely come from looking at companies local to where you live. For example, I straight up just emailed my resume to the CS departments at universities near my home, and a couple professors reached out, offering to have me conduct research with them over the summer. I didn't end up taking either of them up on it, but it showed me that you just have to have an idea of where to look for opportunities.
