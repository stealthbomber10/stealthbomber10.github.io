Interning this summer has been pretty nice (props to Amazon), so I thought I'd write the post that I wish had been out there for me to read when I was trying to get a job in the tech industry. There's a lot I learned in the past year or so, #1 being that **this stuff is not intuitive at all**. For one thing, we live in a world where internships require past internship experience. You have a lot to learn.

Gettig an offer is all about finding opportunities and taking advantage of them. Like anything else, it's a skill that needs to be learned.

Some of this is what I've learned from reading other similar posts about internship help. I'll be taking what I actually found useful from those sources and aggregating them here, plus compounding it with what I saw firsthand. Essentially, this is an info dump of anything I think is useful to know.

This advice is aimed at US undergrads in their sophomore or junior year of university who don't go to a target engineering school, or even one that's well-ranked (like mine).  Sorry internationals, I don't share your struggles so I can't really provide any help. You could always just to go to Hong Kong like I did last summer (highly recommend). If you go to MIT or Stanford, you're pretty much set, and you've probably been groomed since you were young to know this stuff already.

Receiving an offer boils down to two major things:
1. Getting an Interview
2. Killing the Interview

These events are mutually exclusive and non-cumulative. Once you've gotten the interview, all that matters is how you do *in* said interview.

## Hacking your Resume

You don't want a crappy resume to be the reason you're not getting interviews. This is the only thing recruiters are looking at to choose who to interview, so you need to make it as dynamite as you can. Mine from freshman year absolutely sucked, so I scrapped it a year later and made a new one.

Luckily, there are templates that other people have made for you. In my opinion, you should just go with the [Deedy Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). It's clean, it'll show you're in with the Hacker News hipster CS crowd, and it might even be your first introduction to LaTeX. I guarantee that it's better than anything you'll end up making from scratch. You can thank me later.

[These](https://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/) templates 
are nice if you want something more bare-bones, and [this one](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv) is also pretty good. Still can't go wrong with Deedy.

Put down *as much* technical experience as you can. My recruiters and interviewers never asked or cared about anything non-technical on my resume. Only put down that stuff if you really have nothing else to write (like I did), and even then just try to think of something.

Make a GitHub and a personal website (see my post [here](https://trentandraka.me/guide/2017/09/09/personal-site-guide.html), though some of it is out-of-date), and put both down on your resume. The big companies will never look at either when you're applying, but they look good to have on there. Upload anything technical you've worked on to GitHub and put links to the repos on your resume. A link to a live demo, especially, is money.

Include the higher of your cumulative and major GPA. Leave it off completely if they're both less than 3.0. Your GPA doesn't matter much anyways, **even if** it doesn't meet the requirement they ask for when you apply. To give a personal example, one company made me an internship offer despite not meeting their required GPA; it's not a hard minimum.

Don't BS the skills you list on your resume. Making yourself look good on paper is fine and dandy, but if you get called out on your stuff in the interview it can look very bad. Don't lie when you're hyping yourself up.

List hard numbers and statistics. They sound nice to recruiters and make your accomplishments more well-defined. I guarantee that if there's one thing wrong with your resume, it's that you're being too qualitative where you should be being quantitative.

## Finding an "in"

**Don't apply online**. It won't work. I think I only got one response in the last *year* from the "fire and forget" mass application method, out of the dozens of companies I applied to, and it was months after I had already accepted an offer. I'm not sure why we were even talking at that point. Applying online and then twiddling your thumbs for a while is the strategy you use if you've exhausted all your other options with a company (or if you simply don't want to put in the extra effort).

Like in product sales, the key to selling yourself isn't spamming your message, but rather lead generation. The better the lead, the better the sale (of you).

I literally got a referral at one of the [FAANG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) through cold emailing a current employee in one of the [HN jobs](http://hnhiring.me/) threads. 

Here's an example. The first interview I got was in mid-September, through my school's career fair. My first interview that semester subsequently also led to my first summer internship offer.

I took some inspiration from [this genius](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-doing-something-i-love-landed-me-a-top-tier-tech-internship-fe78d8b74e48) and hit up nearly every recruiter I had contacted earlier and even some new ones.

Dropbox sent me a HackerRank challenge only because I doxxed a recruiter and told her I had another offer on the table. I didn't advance past the challenge, but at that point is was all about my ability to advance. That's all about you can really ask for with this stuff.

You can bet I felt like a big baller when I told them to piss off and smashed that delete button.

## Acing the Interview

Once you've secured the interview, your performance on the programming portion is literally the only thing that determines whether you get the job or not. Everything else is irrelevant. I remember that [this piece](https://www.alexkras.com/whiteboard-interviews-suck-get-good-at-them-anyway/) was a big eye-opener for me.

Also, I hope you have the attention span to be reading this post all the way through (and not as you advance throughout the internship process), cause prepping for this stage should really start way before you actually reach it. Like Lincoln said himself, "Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four hours sharpening the axe."

The schedule [this guy](https://reginaldlong.com/how-i-went-from-failing-every-interview-to-a-job-at-amazon/) followed isn't too shabby. Only thing I would change is stick to CTCI and the easy to medium questions on Leetcode (don't bother with the hard ones). The process outlined [here](https://reginaldlong.com/how-do-i-practice-an-interview-problem/) (by the same guy no less) is a fantastic way to practice these questions. Making programming questions a morning or evening a routine isn't a bad way to practice:

That's all the advice I can think of. If you want more info on anything I talked about, or even something I didn't, shoot me an email. I look at everything that gets sent my way.

## Appendix: freshman edition

You'll notice that I didn't mention freshmen at all. Truth is, it's difficult for most freshman to get an internship at these big tech companies unless you're at a top school or are a rockstar programmer (in which case I don't know why you kept reading after the last fourth or fifth paragraph). Your best bet is to apply to a ~~leftist diversity program~~ specialized freshman engineering internship, e.g. something like the [Microsoft Explore Program](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/explore) or [Facebook's Engineering University](https://www.facebook.com/careers/university/fbueng) thing. Either that, or try to leverage any sort of connections you might have, whether it be from school, friends, family, or something else.

Your highest chance of success, however, will most likely come from looking at companies local to where you live. For example, I straight up just emailed my resume to the CS departments at universities near my home, and a couple professors reached out, offering to have me conduct research with them over the summer. I didn't end up taking either of them up on it, but it showed me that you just have to have an idea of where to look for opportunities.
