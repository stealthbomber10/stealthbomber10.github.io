Now that I've finally accepted an internship offer for the summer (thanks Amazon), I thought I'd write the post that I wish had been out there for me to read when I was trying to get a job in the tech industry. There's a lot I learned in the last few months, #1 being that **this stuff is not intuitive at all**. I don't get how undergrads figure half of this crap out, let alone some of the freshman that do. I did not know *anything* as a freshman.

Some of this is what I've learned from reading other similar posts about internship help. I'll be taking what I actually found useful from those sources and aggregating them here, and compounding it with what I saw firsthand.

I'm still absolutely not deserving at all of my offer, despite how I might otherwise make it seem. Receiving an offer is all about finding opportunities and taking advantage of them. That's all it is. It's a skill to learn.

This advice is aimed at US undergrads in their sophomore or junior year of university who don't go to a target engineering school or even one that's well ranked.  Sorry internationals, I don't share your struggles so I can't really provide any help. You could always just to go to Hong Kong like I did last summer (highly recommend). I'm also providing advice for those of us who don't go a target engineering school or even one that's decently ranked (like mine). If you go to MIT or Stanford, you're honestly pretty much set. Go complain about safe spaces or something.

You'll also notice that I didn't mention freshmen at all. The truth is, if you're a freshman, it's difficult (for most people) to get an internship at these big tech companies unless you're a rockstar programmer at one of these top schools (in which case I don't know why you kept reading after the last paragraph). Your best bet is to apply to a ~~leftist diversity program~~ specialized freshman engineering internship, e.g. something like the [Microsoft Explore Program](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/explore) or [Facebook's Engineering University thing](https://www.facebook.com/careers/university/fbueng). Either that, or try to leverage any sort of connections you might have, whether it be from school, friends, family, or something else.

<!-- Your highest chance of success, however, will most likely come from looking at companies local to where you live. For example, I straight up just emailed my resume to the CS departmenrs at universities where I lived, and a couple professors reached out, offering to have me conduct research with them over the summer. I didn't end up taking either of them up on it, but shows that you just have to have an idea of where to look for opportunities. -->

Dropbox sent me a HackerRank challenge only because I doxxed a recruiter and told her I had another offer on the table. I didn't advance past the challenge, but at that point is was all about my ability to advance, which is all you can ask for with this stuff.

I took some inspiration from [this genius](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-doing-something-i-love-landed-me-a-top-tier-tech-internship-fe78d8b74e48) and hit up nearly every recruiter I had contacted earlier and even some new ones.

You can bet I felt like a big baller when I told them to piss off and smashed that delete button.

There are really two big parts to the process:
1. Getting an Interview
2. Killing the Interview

Contrary to popular belief, these do not relate to each other. What gets you the interview does not get you the job. Once you have the interview, it's about your performance *in* that interview and nothing else.

##Hacking your Resume

You don't want a crappy resume to be the reason you're not getting interviews. This is the only thing recruiters are looking at to choose who to interview, so you need to make it as dynamite as you can. Mine from freshman year absolutely sucked, so I scrapped it a year later and made a completely new resume.

Luckily, there are templates that other people have made for you. Honestly, just use the (Deedy Resume)[https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume]. It's clean, it'll show you're in with the HN-hipster CS crowd, and it might even be your first introduction to LaTeX. I guarantee that it's better than anything you'll end up making from scratch. You can thank me later.

(This template)[https://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv] is also pretty good, and so are (these)[https://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/] if you want something more bare-bones.

##Copping an Interview

##Killing the Interview

Once you've secured the interview, your performance as judged by the interviewer is the only thing that determines whether you get the job. Your resume, grades, and projects do not matter at that poin at all at that point.
