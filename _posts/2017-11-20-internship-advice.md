Now that I've finally accepted an internship offer for the summer (thanks Amazon), I thought I'd write the post that I wish had been out there for me to read when I was trying to get a job in the tech industry. There's a lot I learned in the last few months , #1 being that **this stuff is not intuitive at all**. I don't get how undergrads figure half of this crap out, let alone some of the freshman that do. I did not know *anything* as a freshman.

I'm still absolutely not deserving at all of my offer, despite how I might otherwise make it seem. Receiving an offer is just as much about 

This advice is aimed at US undergrads in their sophomore or junior year of university who don't go to a target engineering school or even one that's well ranked.  Sorry internationals, I don't share your struggles so I can't really provide any help. You could always just to go to Hong Kong like I did last summer (highly recommend). I'm also providing advice for those of us who don't go a target engineering school or even one that's decently ranked (like mine). If you go to MIT or Stanford, you're honestly pretty much set. Go play some video games or something.

Dropbox sent me a HackerRank challenge only because I doxxed a recruiter and told her I had another offer on the table. I didn't advance past the challenge, but it's nice 

You'll also notice that I didn't mention freshman.

You can bet I felt like a big baller when I told them to piss off and smashed that delete button.
