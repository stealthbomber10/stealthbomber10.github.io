Now that I've finally accepted an offer for the summer, I thought I'd write the post that I wish had been out there for me to read when I was thinking about applying to tech internships. There's a lot I learned throughout the entire process of the last few months, #1 being that **this stuff is not intuitive at all**. I don't get how undergrads figure half of this crap out, let alone some of the freshman that do. I did not know *anything* as a freshman.

This advice is aimed at US undergrads in their sophomore or junior year of university who don't go to a target engineering school or even one that's well ranked.  Sorry internationals, I don't share your struggles so I can't really provide any help. You could always just to go to Hong Kong like I did last summer (highly recommend).

I am absolutely not deserving at all of my offer, despite how I might otherwise make it seem.

You can bet I felt like a big baller when I told them to piss off and smashed that delete button.
