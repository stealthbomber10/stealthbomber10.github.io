I started this blog in August 2017 right before entering my sophomore year of college. I wanted my own outlet for publishing things that I wanted to read but couldn't find anywhere else on the web. I also wanted a personal site to point friends, professors, and employers to.

I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. You can find my GitHub in the site footer, and if you want to connect with me on LinkedIn, you can go to my [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trentandraka/).

I read all my email too, so feel free to send messages to the address at the bottom of the page.
